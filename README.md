## Overview
Sample JavaScript console application illustrating object-oriented and domain-driven design principles in the context of Supply Chain Management and Procurement.

## Features
Main  business concepts include:
- Suppliers
- Purchase Orders
- Purchase Order Items
- Money and Currency
- DateTime for order dates
- Bounded Contexts (Shared, SCM, Procurement)
- Domain-specific validations

## Object-Oriented Programming and Domain-Driven Design principles and concepts
The project demonstrates the following principles and concepts:
- Encapsulation: Each class encapsulates its data and behavior.
- Abstraction: Complex logic is abstracted away in methods.
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has a single responsibility.
- Bounded Contexts: Different modules represent different domains.
- Value Objects: Money and DateTime are represented as value objects.
- Aggregate Roots: Purchase Order is an aggregate root that manages its items.
- State Management: Purchase Order state transitions are managed through methods.
